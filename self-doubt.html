                <br>
                <p>June 19, 2018</p>
                <hr>
                <p></h2>

                <p><h1>Do you remember the last timeyou decided to do something new and a little bit stressful?</h1> It could be: confronting a colleague, travelling to a new country or sharing a vulnerable message on social media... If this event contents even a small risk of rejection, judgment or disappointment, the agmycdola part of your brain lights up and triggers a safety plan. It's time to protect yourself!</p>


                <p>Your agmycdola is your central risk-manager (flight, fight, freeze response), as well as the part of your brain in charge of decision-making, memory-processing and emotional-response.</p>

                <b><h1>How do we respond when the agmycdola is triggered?</h1></b> 

                <p>We choose one of the 5 P's of self-doubt: procrastination, perfectionnism, passive behavior, proving yourself or paralysis. Whether the event is happening right or you are remembering it, your agmycdola will react to it the same way, by protecting yourself. How do we move past stress, overwhelm and fears and overcome self-doubt? </p>

                <b><h1>How do you start confronting self-doubt?</h1></b>

                <p>One fact about self-doubt is that it thrives in confusion and over-generalization. For example: "always, never, no one, everyone, all the times." You need to start getting more specific to tackle self-doubt. For example: "I will never get a promotion" VS "At the last quarter meeting, I received positive feedback about my leadership skills and I have a 1:1 meeting scheduled with my boss next month." ; "I am not good at sales" VS "I sold my package to 5 clients last month." It is important ...</p>

                <p>Let's start questioning your self-doubt so that you can take more risks in your life ;)</p>
                <br>

                <b><h1>The Self-Doubt Exercice</h1></b>
                <br>

                <ol><h2><li>What is the area of your life where you experience the most self-doubt?</li></h2>
                Choose from: work & career, relationship, health & wellness, friendships, personal growth & learning, creativity & play, finances, family…)
                <br>
                <br>

                <h2><li>How does self-doubt show up in this area of your life?</li></h2>
                Allow yourself to explore this question for a few minutes. For example: I am afraid to talk to my manager, I doubt about myself as a new project leader, I need to have a frank discussion with my team but I don't know how to communicate with clarity and confidence to them...</i>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h2><li>What is at risk for you?</li></h2>
                Get really clear and specific, then summarize it into two sentences. For example: I am risking my credibility as a project leader and I am risking the success of the project.
                <br>
                <br>

                <h2><li>What do you do to avoid the risk?</li></h2>
                How are you protecting yourself? What do you feel, say, think and do when you feel this self-doubt rising? For example: I pretend that everything is ok, I don't ask for help, and I overwork to make sure that the deadlines are met.
                <br>
                <br>

                <h2><li>What choices do you have apart from avoiding the risk?</li></h2>
                Open-up, be curious and bring up some new ideas. What could I do? What choices do I have? What resources do I already have within myself? What is available for me right now?
                <br>
                <br>

                <h2><li>What is the safest, smallest, most doable step you can take right now?</li></h2>
                Taking a specific action will help transform the belief that avoiding the risk is necessary. When will you do it? Who do you want to share it with? 
                <br>
                <br>

                <h2><li>Why is it important for you to do it? Why does that matter?</li></h2>
                This is where you keep yourself accountable and dig deep into who you want to become and how overcome self-self will positively impact your life. 

                <br>

                <p><h2>By consistently questioning your self-doubt, you will start to expand your tolerance for risks and live with more clarity, more creativity, and more ease. ;)</h2></p>
