In our first session, I was able to change unhelpful beliefs, accept important personal truths, and experience my own version of self-love that I could access anytime now. I also left the session with tools to continue going deeper. Enora approached our session with so much compassion, and was clearly tuned to my unique needs as a client. I felt truly supported and would recommend her highly!"</p>

                          <p>"Being coached by Enora is a very intentional experience. You can feel how much she cares about you and how present she is with you in the session. I feel completely heard during our sessions. She prioritizes what I'm dealing with, what I want, and goes at my pace as we work through the issues I'm facing.</p>
                          <p>She's also great at harnessing my imagination and ability to visualize to help me see different possible futures and understand my situation in new ways. She keeps the sessions structured and progressing while also giving me time and space to process what I'm thinking.</p>
                          <p>Working with her has made me feel supported, confident, and productive. For anyone considering coaching, Enora will get you connected with what you truly want and give you the confidence to go out there and make it happen. "</p>

                                  <p>"When my first session with Enora began, I immediately felt comforted by her centered presence. She was open about herself and the process she’s working with, but kept the focus on me, focusing on what I thought and how I can use the knowledge I already have to shape better strategies for myself.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>Working with Enora felt like an organic conversation with a wise friend, as she guided me towards the answer I already knew, but had gotten confused about in all the noise from other sources. Her grounded presence felt soothing in talking about difficult issues, and her strong listening reflected back what I said so that I could see more objectively what’s to be done.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>As she asked open questions to consider why I’m not living in the way that I believe I should, she naturally guided me towards my highest vision for myself. I’d definitely recommend coaching with Enora if you want to find deeper insight into how you can move closer to your vision of success."

We focused on my wellbeing and how to take better care of myself (a daily routine including sleeping habits, yoga and breathing techniques). What helped me most was to verbalize with someone who doesn't know me, which allowed me to clarify my thoughts and to put into practice defined and clear action steps."</p>
