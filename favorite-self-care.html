            <h2>
              Self-Care is made of happy, healthy and fulfilling daily habits. This is my usual routine :)

              Morning
            </h1>
            <h3>
              Waking up and Writing
            </h3>
            <p>
              I wake up early to be able to write when it's still dark outside. At this time, I feel inspired, focused 
              and super productive. It's the best start for the day ahead!
            </p>
            <h3>
              Drinking Water
            </h3>
            <p>
              I always have a bottle of water by my bed. My feet don't touch the ground until I get a couple sips of water. 
              It helps me clear my mind and feel fresh and grounded.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Fun Meditation
            </h3>
            <p>
              I smile and mentally announce: "This day is going to be full of Love and Excitement and Creativity and Fun..." 
              Then I smile at how grateful and happy I am to be here.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Expressing Love
            </h3>
            <p>
              I tell my wife how much I love her and I pet my dog :) 
            </p>
            <h3>
              Preparing a healthy breakfast
            </h3>
            <p>
              Right now, it's delicious oat meal, lactose-free milk and figs/bananas. I love it!
            </p>
            <h3>
              Creativity
            </h3>
            <p>
              I draw every morning about what made me smile the previous day. I have hundreds of those drawings, capturing 
              moments of our family lives. I pack some as a surprise for my wife's lunch :) I also color or do some 
              dot-to-dot, depending on how creative I am.</p>
            <h3>
              Exercising and Getting some fresh air
            </h3>
            <p>
              This one is a variable one. I walk my dog 3 times a day, that's a given. I used to do yoga 5 days a week in 
              a yoga studio. I even used to do yoga in the morning AND in the evening. Now, I'm slowly coming back to 20 
              minutes every morning before breakfast (working on it :).
            <h3>
              Time to Work
            </h3>
            <p>
              By that point, I am back home and sitting at my office. I take a piece of paper and write down 3 tasks I 
              want to achieve today. I break them down to be achievable the same day. I tackle my most important tasks 
              in the morning, so I feel proud and accomplished for the rest of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                Extra tip:
              </b> 
              On my calendar, my tasks are broken down on an hour basis. For example: 10-11am: writing 
              article about xyz. 12-1pm: coaching session with xyz. 2-3pm: marketing on xyz. It helps me to structure my 
              day and to focus exactly on what I am doing, knowing that I've already dedicated time for the other tasks 
              of the day. Big win for my peace of mind.
            </p>
            <h3>
              No Notifications
            </h3>
            <p>
              This one is a big one. My cellphone is ALWAYS on mute and has ZERO notifications. 24/7. No email, no social 
              medias, no texts notifications. Nothing. When I check my phone to read my emails, my calendar or messenger, 
              it's because I want to, not the other way around. That's my #1 life saver.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                Extra tip:
              </b>
              I check my agenda in the morning and then it is memorized. When I dedicate time to check 
              my emails (twice a day), I have 3 options: I answer them, delete them or classify them. Then, I move on 
              to the next fun thing to do :)
            </p>

              Afternoon

              Lunch break
            </h3>
            <p>
              I eat mostly the same thing every day. Simple and reassuring. Right now, delicious omelette with spinach :D. 
              And lots of snacks during the day, like fruit, milk, almonds, chocolate.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Fun Activities
            </h3>
            <p>
              In the afternoon, I am not always as productive. Morning is my pick of productivity. In the afternoon, I swim, 
              hike, or do anything active outside.

              Cellphone on airplane mode. Minimalist and organized bedroom. Fresh water on my bedside. Extra books or guided 
              meditation if I can't sleep. I try as much as I can to stay screen-free at night.
