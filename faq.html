              Frequently Asked Questions:
            </h1><br>
            <h2>
              <b>1. What is coaching?</b>
            </h2>
            <p>
              We work together to clarify your short-term and long-term goals. Then, we create a map of practical and simple 
              actions to move you forward. I ask you questions to clarify your beliefs and habits so that you can transform 
              what is blocking you. I provide a safe place without advice or judgment where you grow at your own pace. I also 
              provide customized tools and homework to help you thrive between sessions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
              <b>2. How is coaching different from consulting?</b>
            </h2>
            <p>
              A consultant gives expertise advices to solve a problem. They lead the session, analyse the issue, come up with 
              a map and solve the problem. The client remains dependent on the consultant to solve a particular issue.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coaching is different. You acquire customized skills to know exactly how to transform your beliefs and habits 
              on your own, which benefits all areas of your life - relationships, health, finances..., and lead you to your 
              own independence and success.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
              <b>3. How long does a session last?</b>
            </h2>
            <p>
              Each session lasts one hour and is held over via Zoom/Skype/Phone or in person in Los Angeles.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>
              <b>4. What should I expect from my first coaching session with you?</b>
            </h2>
            <p>
              Your first coaching will assist you to define with clarity your goals and your expectations for coaching. We will 
              define together the best ways to achieve your short-term and long-term projects. We will then work together on the 
              goal of your choice. Ready to take action? Please send me an email at <b>hey.enora@gmail.com</b>.
