              CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.

              the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a 
              conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or

              When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s 
              Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer

            <br>
            <p>
              The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States 
              and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection 
              laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should 
              be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices I will take the following responsive action, should 
              a data breach occur, I will notify you via email within 7 business days.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              I also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue 
              enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires 
              not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse 
              to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
