                <p><h1><strong>My Journey to Self-Love.</strong></h1>
                <br>
                <p>October 9, 2017</p>
                <hr>
                <p><h2>Today, I am a happy and healthy person, but it hasn't always been like that.</h2></p>
                <p>As a teenager, I struggled for years with depression, anxiety and eating disorder. Every day was consumed in thoughts over food, obsessive compulsive disorder or how bad a person I was. I was creating more and more lies to hide the truth of my daily life. I started losing friends and losing myself on the way. 

                <p><h2>Realizing that I had a choice: remaining or changing.</h2></p>
                <p>One day, I realized that nothing would change until I made a change in my life. I could have stayed the same person doing the same things over and over again, but I knew my life was more than those habits. I knew my life had infinite possibilities for change. 

                <p><h2>Taking responsibility for myself</h2></p>
                <p>First, I stopped calling myself a victim. Then, something fundamental changed: I owned my story. I started telling the truth to friends I trusted. I accepted the ups and downs of my life and my character. I became a more complex person in my own eyes and the eyes of others, but most importantly, I became whole with myself.
                <p><h2>Starting to take better care of myself</h2></p>
                <p>I started reading books and doing research on what people do to feel happy, healthy and fulfilled. I applied those concepts into my life and, with a lot of trial and error, I began making drastic changes from the inside out.</p>
                <p><h2>Learning about myself.</h2></p>
                <p>I looked closely at my fears, doubts, and limiting patterns. I met new people, learned new ways of thinking and behaving, and transformed my actions and beliefs. I learned to love myself. My thoughts became more clear, sharp, and aligned with the person I wanted to be. Because I was so focused on growing, there was little space left for the old destructive thoughts. I reshaped my mind and the world was new under my feet.</p>

                <p><h2>This is what I changed in my life</h2></p>

                <p><h2>Today</h2></p>
                <p>Today I love who I am. My mind is clear and focused. I feel good about taking care of myself. I have control over my thoughts and my habits. I forgave myself and feel free and happy. I finally honor the fact that I am never responsible for someone else’s feelings but only for my own happiness. I create the life that I want. I love who I became. </p>
